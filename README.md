### Hi, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

I'm software developer who's interested in programming, smart home technology and home heating.

I make YouTube videos over at https://youtube.com/@tomasmcguinness and blog, very unpredictably, at https://www.tomasmcguinness.com

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a .Net implementation of the Matter Protocol.

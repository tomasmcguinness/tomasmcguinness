### Hi, I'm Tom 👋

I'm software developer who's interested in programming, smart home technology and home heating.

I make YouTube videos over at https://youtube.com/@tomasmcguinness and blog, very unpredictably at https://www.tomasmcguinness.com

🔭 I’m currently working on building a Zigbee dual temperature probe.
